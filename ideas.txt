Concept: A simple display-only tool for tracking
Pokemon acquisitions and team changes during
a nuzlocke run. Specifically tuned for that
challenge, but ideally flexible enough to be
useful for other purposes.

Written in Love2D and the Lua language, for
easier approachabilty by other programmers.

Panes
=====
Party
PC Box (Up to any number, configurable by user)
Areas

Pokemon
=======
- Number (entry, probably want to support multiple
  numbering sets from each region)
- Nickname
- Status (Mostly Dead)
- Derived Data fron Number:
-- Icon
-- Name (Original, Pidgey instead of BirdJesus)
-- Type (Need to support type changes over series)

Each Pokemon Icon can be fully edited. Except for
derived data display, there are no rules and the
player is in full control. For the number, simple
+ / - keys are provided to assist with evolution.
This will not automatically handle things like
special evolutions (Eevee) and I don't care to
maintain it.

Every single Pokemon slot can be moved around.

Note: DO THIS FIRST. (Most useful thing.) Ignore
region and just do Kanto numbering, and the
original 151's icons for each creature. Don't hunt
for GBA+ unique menu icons until later.

Party
=====
Simply shows the 6 Pokemon in the party, nothing
more. Highlights the first (and second, later)
Pokemon to come out in a given battle, but has
no other special features. Despite its simplicity,
this will likely be the most used pane.

Box
===
Similar to Party, displays less information for
compactness. Original boxes hold up to 20 Pokemon,
so we'll need to squeeze those onscreen somehow.
Might need a scrolling / paging behavior for small
windows, and this should probably be a user option

Routes
======
Displays a shadow Pokemon entry for each route and
area in a run. These areas should probably be
set in advance for each type of run. "Moving" a
Pokemon from another area into each route slot
sets it for display. Each slot can also be
disabled for various reasons (Missed a Pokemon,
not used for this run, etc.)
